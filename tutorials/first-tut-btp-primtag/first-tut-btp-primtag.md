The Enterprise Sales and Procurement Model (`ESPM`) is a reference application that demonstrates how you can build Java-based applications on the SAP Cloud Platform, Neo environment. To showcase the rich set of capabilities and application services the platform offers today, the ESPM application consumes services such as Persistence, Document Service, SAP Jam, API Management and Authorization Management. The technologies the application uses are OData, JPA and the SAP HANA Database. The application User Interface (UI) is built with the SAPUI5 framework following the SAP Fiori design principles.
